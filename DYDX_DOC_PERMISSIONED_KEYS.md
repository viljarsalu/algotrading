Title: Permissioned Keys

Markdown Content:
Permissioned Keys provide a way for different traders to share the same account. Using this mechanism, the owner of an account can provide different types of permissions, allowing flexibility to what and what not the permissioned users can do with its account.

A permission, or set of permissions, is also known as an **authenticator**. See all available authenticator types [here](https://docs.dydx.xyz/concepts/trading/authenticators).

This section will guide you through authenticators use and management. We show the two sides of this authenticating interaction. We'll label the main user, which gives the permissiones, as the **owner**, and the permissioned user as the **trader**.

There are 2 ways to setup Permissioned API Keys: 1/ Via the Trade interface (default permissions to trade on all cross-margin pairs) 2/ Via API (customisable)

### Setup Permissioned API Keys via Trade Interface

![Image 1: Setup Permissioned API Key](https://docs.dydx.xyz/APIKey.png)

On the dYdX.trade, after signing in with your wallet or socials:

*   click `More â†’ API Trading Keys`.
*   Click `Generate New API Key`. This generates a new keypair:
    *   API Wallet Address
    *   Private Key

*   Check the `terms` and click `Authorize API Key`.
*   Now you can go to [Import private key](https://docs.dydx.xyz/interaction/permissioned-keys#trader) to start trading via API keys.

### Create an authenticator

Alternatively, you can create a custom authenticator which allows only the **trader** to place orders.

To create this authenticator, we use two sub-authenticators: `signatureVerification` and `messageFilter`:

*   the `signatureVerification` authenticator must be present in all authenticator sets and contains the **trader**'s public key;
*   the `messageFilter` authenticator must contain the gRPC message ID of the allowed transaction (here `MsgPlaceOrder`).

We compose everything together using the composable authenticator `AllOf`, stating that some **trader**'s transaction is only allowed if it complies with all the authenticators.

The **trader** also needs to send the **owner** the its public key, associated with its address. This can be done by encoding the public key (e.g., hex string) and sending it. The **owner** then decodes it, serving it as input below.

Python

```
# trader_key = trader_wallet.public_key.key
auth = Authenticator.compose(
    # All sub-authenticators must be valid.
    AuthenticatorType.AllOf,
    [
        # The allowed account.
        Authenticator.signature_verification(trader_key),
        # The allowed action.
        Authenticator.message_filter("/dydxprotocol.clob.MsgPlaceOrder"),
    ],
)
```

### Add the authenticator

Now we need to push the authenticator to the network.

Python

```
# Add the authenticator.
response = await node.add_authenticator(wallet, auth)
```

### List authenticators

You can confirm if the authenticator was added by listing all the authenticators associated with your (owner) address.

The added authenticator, identified by an ID (integer), will appear last on the list. The **trader** will then need to use this ID.

Python

```
# List authenticators.
authenticators = await node.get_authenticators(wallet.address)
# Grab the last authenticator ID.
id = authenticators.account_authenticators[-1]
```

### Remove the authenticator

Authenticators can be removed if they are needed anymore, or if the **trader** goes rogue.

Python

```
# Remove the authenticator.
response = await node.remove_authenticator(wallet, id)
```

### Get the authenticator ID and permissioned API Key

Grab the `authenticatorId` created by the **owner** in [Add authenticator](https://docs.dydx.xyz/interaction/permissioned-keys#add-the-authenticator), either by:

*   request the **owner** for the `authenticatorId` or by using the list authenticators method to fetch the to be used authenticator (see [list authenticators](https://docs.dydx.xyz/interaction/permissioned-keys#last-authenticators)).
*   Get the private key `DYDX_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY` from the owner in [via the Trade Interface](https://docs.dydx.xyz/interaction/permissioned-keys#get-the-private-key).

### Setup the permissioned wallet

If you got a private key from the trading interface load in via `fromPrivateKey`, otherwise use `fromMnemonic` if you didn't create via the trading interface by assigning to mnemonic.

```
const fromWallet = await LocalWallet.fromPrivateKey(DYDX_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY, BECH32_PREFIX);
  const authenticatedSubaccount = SubaccountInfo.forPermissionedWallet(
        fromWallet,
        address, //owner dydx address
        subaccountNumber, //subaccount to trade onbehalf of
        [authenticatorId],
      )
```

### Using the authenticator

The **trader** can now use the permissioned API key to perform the allowed trading actions.

In this example, the **trader** can use the authenticator to issue orders on the behalf of the **owner**.

TypeScript

```
const client = await CompositeClient.connect(network);
// Place an order using the authenticator.
const tx = await client.placeShortTermOrder(
  authenticatedSubaccount,
  'ETH-USD',
  side,
  price,
  0.01,
      clientId,
      goodTilBlock,
      timeInForce,
      false,
      undefined,
    );
```
